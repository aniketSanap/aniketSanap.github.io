    "Now that you have some experience with LSTMs and language models, you will attempt to build a word level language model. While we were directly passing one hot encoded vectors as input to our character model, we need to do better than that for a word level. A word in itself contains a lot of information which a character does not. This is why we use word embeddings. Word embeddings are essentially just vector representations of input words. These vectors can capture a lot of semantic information which would otherwise be lost if we one hot encoded vectors for words. There are a lot of pretrained word embeddings created using different algorithms like Word2Vec, Glove, CoVE, ELMo etc. You can use any of these or simply add your own `nn.Embedding` layer to your model. The `nn.Embedding` layer acts as a trainable lookup table. This means that it contains `len(vocab)` number of rows and `embedding_size` number of columns."
